There seems to be a correlation between the degree speeches/answers are finessed
and the unique word count: the more polished the lower the count. However, at
the Grand Hotel Thatcher's spoke without an autocue yet the unique word count
suggests it was very well rehearsed (32%). Similarly May's Brexit speech and the
2017 Conservative manifesto also have low counts (29-31%) but surprisingly
Blair's quick fire responses to Paxman boast the lowest percentage of unique
words of all speeches analysed (27%).

Some quotes of note:

Theresa May Brexit
- friends and new allies (2) 
- culture is profoundly internationalist (2) 
- control of our own laws (2)
- will always want immigration (2)

UKIP manifesto
- I have always believed that UKIP is at its best when it is
being radical. (Opening statement)
- Every political party except UKIP has thrown its weight behind the 2008
Climate Change Act. Set to cost us an eye-watering £319 billion

Green Party manifesto
- 1: confident and caring britain (11)
