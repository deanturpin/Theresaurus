<pre id="speech" width="50%">
A little over 6 months ago, the British people voted for change.

They voted to shape a brighter future for our country.

They voted to leave the European Union and embrace the world.

And they did so with their eyes open: accepting that the road ahead will be
uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for
their children — and their grandchildren too.

And it is the job of this government to deliver it. That means more than
negotiating our new relationship with the E.U. It means taking the opportunity
of this great moment of national change to step back and ask ourselves what kind
of country we want to be.

My answer is clear. I want this United Kingdom to emerge from this period of
change stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before.
I want us to be a secure, prosperous, tolerant country — a magnet for
international talent and a home to the pioneers and innovators who will shape
the world ahead. I want us to be a truly Global Britain — the best friend and
neighbor to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders
of Europe too. A country that goes out into the world to build relationships
with old friends and new allies alike.

I want Britain to be what we have the potential, talent and ambition to be. A
great, global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong,
confident and united at home.

That is why this government has a Plan for Britain. One that gets us the right
deal abroad but also ensures we get a better deal for ordinary working people at
home.

It’s why that plan sets out how we will use this moment of change to build a
stronger economy and a fairer society by embracing genuine economic and social
reform.

Why our new Modern Industrial Strategy is being developed, to ensure every
nation and area of the United Kingdom can make the most of the opportunities
ahead.

Why we will go further to reform our schools to ensure every child has the
knowledge and the skills they need to thrive in post-Brexit Britain.

Why as we continue to bring the deficit down, we will take a balanced approach
by investing in our economic infrastructure — because it can transform the
growth potential of our economy and improve the quality of people’s lives across
the whole country.

It’s why we will put the preservation of our precious Union at the heart of
everything we do. Because it is only by coming together as one great union of
nations and people that we can make the most of the opportunities ahead. The
result of the referendum was not a decision to turn inward and retreat from the
world.

Because Britain’s history and culture is profoundly internationalist.

We are a European country — and proud of our shared European heritage — but we
are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. That
is why we are one of the most racially diverse countries in Europe, one of the
most multicultural members of the European Union, and why — whether we are
talking about India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, America, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, countries in Africa or those that are closer to home in Europe — so
many of us have close friends and relatives from across the world.

Instinctively, we want to travel to, study in, trade with countries not just in
Europe but beyond the borders of our continent. Even now as we prepare to leave
the E.U., we are planning for the next biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government
meeting in 2018 — a reminder of our unique and proud global relationships.

And it is important to recognize this fact. June the 23rd was not the moment
Britain chose to step back from the world. It was the moment we chose to build a
truly Global Britain.

I know that this — and the other reasons Britain took such a decision — is not
always well understood among our friends and allies in Europe. And I know many
fear that this might herald the beginning of a greater unravelling of the E.U.

But let me be clear: I do not want that to happen. It would not be in the best
interests of Britain. It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain’s
national interest that the E.U. should succeed. And that is why I hope in the
months and years ahead we will all reflect on the lessons of Britain’s decision
to leave.

So let me take this opportunity to set out the reasons for our decision and to
address the people of Europe directly.

It’s not simply because our history and culture is profoundly internationalist,
important though that is. Many in Britain have always felt that the United
Kingdom’s place in the European Union came at the expense of our global ties,
and of a bolder embrace of free trade with the wider world.

There are other important reasons too.

Our political traditions are different. Unlike other European countries, we have
no written constitution, but the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty is the
basis of our unwritten constitutional settlement. We have only a recent history
of devolved governance — though it has rapidly embedded itself — and we have
little history of coalition government.

The public expect to be able to hold their governments to account very directly,
and as a result supranational institutions as strong as those created by the
European Union sit very uneasily in relation to our political history and way of
life.

And, while I know Britain might at times have been seen as an awkward member
state, the European Union has struggled to deal with the diversity of its member
countries and their interests. It bends towards uniformity, not flexibility.

David Cameron’s negotiation was a valiant final attempt to make it work for
Britain — and I want to thank all those elsewhere in Europe who helped him reach
an agreement — but the blunt truth, as we know, is that there was not enough
flexi the body of existing E.U. law — into British law.

This will give the country maximum certainty as we leave the E.U. The same rules
and laws will apply on the day after Brexit as they did before. And it will be
for the British Parliament to decide on any changes to that law after full
scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate.

And when it comes to Parliament, there is one other way in which I would like to
provide certainty. I can confirm today that the Government will put the final
deal that is agreed between the UK and the E.U. to a vote in both Houses of
Parliament, before it comes into force.

Our second guiding principle is to build a stronger Britain.

2. Control of our own laws

That means taking control of our own affairs, as those who voted in their
millions to leave the European Union demanded we must.

So we will take back control of our laws and bring an end to the jurisdiction of
the European Court of Justice in Britain. Leaving the European Union will mean
that our laws will be made in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. And
those laws will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across
this country.

Because we will not have truly left the European Union if we are not in control
of our own laws.

3. Strengthen the Union

A stronger Britain demands that we do something else — strengthen the precious
union between the 4 nations of the United Kingdom.

At this momentous time, it is more important than ever that we face the
futureain, and that sheer volume has put pressure on public services, like
schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing, and put a downward
pressure on wages for working class people. As home secretary for 6 years, I
know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to
Britain from Europe.

Britain is an open and tolerant country. We will always want immigration,
especially high-skilled immigration, we will always want immigration from
Europe, and we will always welcome individual migrants as friends. But the
message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear:
Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from
Europe. And that is what we will deliver.

6. Rights for E.U. nationals in Britain, and British nationals in the E.U.

Fairness demands that we deal with another issue as soon as possible too. We
want to guarantee the rights of E.U. citizens who are already living in Britain,
and the rights of British nationals in other member states, as early as we can.

I have told other E.U. leaders that we could give people the certainty they want
straight away, and reach such a deal now.

Many of them favor such an agreement — 1 or 2 others do not — but I want
everyone to know that it remains an important priority for Britain — and for
many other member states — to resolve this challenge as soon as possible.
Because it is the right and fair thing to do.

7. Protect workers’ rights

And a reat, global, trading nation.

This is such a priority for me that when I became Prime Minister I established,
for the first time, a Department for International Trade, led by Liam Fox.

We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the
globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already
expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us. We have started
discussions on future trade ties with countries like Australia, New Zealand and
India. And President-Elect Trump has said Britain is not “at the back of the
queue” for a trade deal with the United States, the world’s biggest economy, but
front of the line.

I know my emphasis on striking trade agreements with countries outside Europe
has led to questions about whether Britain seeks to remain a member of the EU’s
Customs Union. And it is true that full Customs Union membership prevents us
from negotiating our own comprehensive trade deals.

Now, I want Britain to be able to negotiate its own trade agreements. But I also
want tariff-free trade with Europe and cross-border trade there to be as
frictionless as possible.

That means I do not want Britain to be part of the Common Commercial Policy and
I do not want us to be bound by the Common External Tariff. These are the
elements of the Customs Union that prevent us from striking our own
comprehensive trade agreements with other countries. But I do want us to have a
customs agreement with the E.U.

Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an
associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some
elements of it, I hold no preconceived position. I have an open mind on how we
do it. It is not the means that matter, but the ends.

And those ends are clear: I want to remove as many barriers to trade as
possible. And I want Britain to be free to establish our own tariff schedules at
the World Trade Organization, meaning we can reach new trade agreements not just
with the European Union but with old friends and new allies from outside Europe
too.

10. The best place for science and innovation

A Global Britain must also be a country that looks to the future. That means
being one of the best places in the world for science and innovation.

One of our great strengths as a nation is the breadth and depth of our academic
and scientific communities, backed up by some of the world’s best universities.
And we have a proud history of leading and supporting cutting-edge research and
innovation.

So we will also welcome agreement to continue to collaborate with our European
partners on major science, research, and technology initiatives.

From space exploration to clean energy to medical technologies, Britain will
remain at the forefront of collective endeavors to better understand, and make
better, the world in which we live.

11. Cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism

And a Global Britain will continue to cooperate with its European partners in
important areas such as crime, terrorism and foreign affairs.

All of us in Europe face the challenge of cross-border crime, a deadly terrorist
threat, and the dangers presented by hostile states. All of us share interests
and values in common, values we want to see projected around the world.

With the threats to our common security becoming more serious, our response
cannot be to cooperate with one another less, but to work together more. I
therefore want our future relationship with the European Union to include
practical arrangements on matters of law enforcement and the sharing of
intelligence material with our E.U. allies.

I am proud of the role Britain has played and will continue to play in promoting
Europe’s security. Britain has led Europe on the measures needed to keep our
continent secure — whether it is implementing sanctions against Russia following
its action in Crimea, working for peace and stability in the Balkans, or
securing Europe’s external border. We will continue to work closely with our
European allies in foreign and defense policy even as we leave the E.U. itself.

12. A smooth, orderly Brexit

These are our objectives for the negotiation ahead — objectives that will help
to realize our ambition of shaping that stronger, fairer, Global Britain that we
want to see.

They are the basis for a new, strong, constructive partnership with the European
Union — a partnership of friends and allies, of interests and values. A
partnership for a strong E.U. and a strong UK.

But there is one further objective we are setting. For as I have said before —
it is in no one’s interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or a
threat to stability, as we change from our existing relationship to a new
partnership with the E.U.

By this, I do not mean that we will seek some form of unlimited transitional
status, in which we find ourselves stuck forever in some kind of permanent
political purgatory. That would not be good for Britain, but nor do I believe it
would be good for the E.U.

Instead, I want us to have reached an agreement about our future partnership by
the time the 2-year Article 50 process has concluded. From that point onwards,
we believe a phased process of implementation, in which both Britain and the
E.U. institutions and member states prepare for the new arrangements that will
exist between us will be in our mutual self-interest. This will give businesses
enough time to plan and prepare for those new arrangements.

This might be about our immigration controls, customs systems or the way in
which we cooperate on criminal justice matters. Or it might be about the future
legal and regulatory framework for financial services. For each issue, the time
we need to phase-in the new arrangements may differ. Some might be introduced
very quickly, some might take longer. And the interim arrangements we rely upon
are likely to be a matter of negotiation.

But the purpose is clear: we will seek to avoid a disruptive cliff-edge, and we
will do everything we can to phase in the new arrangements we require as Britain
and the E.U. move towards our new partnership.

So, these are the objectives we have set. Certainty wherever possible. Control
of our own laws. Strengthening the United Kingdom. Maintaining the Common Travel
Area with Ireland. Control of immigration. Rights for E.U. nationals in Britain,
and British nationals in the E.U. Enhancing rights for workers. Free trade with
European markets. New trade agreements with other countries. A leading role in
science and innovation. Cooperation on crime, terrorism and foreign affairs. And
a phased approach, delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit.

This is the framework of a deal that will herald a new partnership between the
UK and the E.U.

It is a comprehensive and carefully considered plan that focuses on the ends,
not just the means — with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, and on the kind
of country we will be once we leave.

It reflects the hard work of many in this room today who have worked tirelessly
to bring it together and to prepare this country for the negotiation ahead.

And it will, I know, be debated and discussed at length. That is only right. But
those who urge us to reveal more — such as the blow-by-blow details of our
negotiating strategy, the areas in which we might compromise, the places where
we think there are potential trade-offs — will not be acting in the national
interest.

Because this is not a game or a time for opposition for opposition’s sake. It is
a crucial and sensitive negotiation that will define the interests and the
success of our country for many years to come. And it is vital that we maintain
our discipline.

That is why I have said before — and will continue to say — that every stray
word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get
the right deal for Britain. Our opposite numbers in the European Commission know
it, which is why they are keeping their discipline. And the ministers in this
government know it too, which is why we will also maintain ours.

So however frustrating some people find it, the government will not be pressured
into saying more than I believe it is in our national interest to say. Because
it is not my job to fill column inches with daily updates, but to get the right
deal for Britain. And that is what I intend to do.

I am confident that a deal — and a new strategic partnership between the UK and
the E.U. — can be achieved.

This is firstly because, having held conversations with almost every leader from
every single E.U. member state; having spent time talking to the senior figures
from the European institutions, including President Tusk, President Juncker, and
President Schulz; and after my Cabinet colleagues David Davis, Philip Hammond
and Boris Johnson have done the same with their interlocutors, I am confident
that the vast majority want a positive relationship between the UK and the E.U.
after Brexit.

And I am confident that the objectives I am setting out today are consistent
with the needs of the E.U. and its member states.

That is why our objectives include a proposed Free Trade Agreement between
Britain and the European Union, and explicitly rule out membership of the EU’s
Single Market. Because when the EU’s leaders say they believe the 4 freedoms of
the Single Market are indivisible, we respect that position. When the 27 member
states say they want to continue their journey inside the European Union, we not
only respect that fact but support it.

Because we do not want to undermine the Single Market, and we do not want to
undermine the European Union. We want the E.U. to be a success and we want its
remaining member states to prosper. And of course we want the same for Britain.

And the second reason I believe it is possible to reach a good deal is that the
kind of agreement I have described today is the economically rational thing that
both Britain and the E.U. should aim for. Because trade is not a zero sum game:
more of it makes us all more prosperous. Free trade between Britain and the
European Union means more trade, and more trade means more jobs and more wealth
creation. The erection of new barriers to trade, meanwhile, means the reverse:
less trade, fewer jobs, lower growth.

The third and final reason I believe we can come to the right agreement is that
cooperation between Britain and the E.U. is needed not just when it comes to
trade but when it comes to our security too.

Britain and France are Europe’s only 2 nuclear powers. We are the only 2
European countries with permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.
Britain’s armed forces are a crucial part of Europe’s collective defense.

And our intelligence capabilities — unique in Europe — have alreadresponsibility
to respect the legitimacy of the outcome. And the country comes together.

And that is what we are seeing today. Business isn’t calling to reverse the
result, but planning to make a success of it. The House of Commons has voted
overwhelmingly for us to get on with it. And the overwhelming majority of people
— however they voted — want us to get on with it too.

So that is what we will do.

Not merely forming a new partnership with Europe, but building a stronger,
fairer, more Global Britain too.

And let that be the legacy of our time. The prize towards which we work. The
destination at which we arrive once the negotiation is done.

And let us do it not for ourselves, but for those who follow. For the country’s
children and grandchildren too.

So that when future generations look back at this time, they will judge us not
only by the decision that we made, but by what we made of that decision.

They will see that we shaped them a brighter future.

They will know that we built them a better Britain.
