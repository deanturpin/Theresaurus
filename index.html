<!-- Speech is written here -->
<pre id="speech" width="50%">
There seems to be a correlation between the degree speeches/answers are finessed
and the unique word count: the more polished, the lower the count. However, at
the Grand Hotel Thatcher spoke without an autocue yet the unique word count
suggests it was very well rehearsed (32%). Similarly May's Brexit speech and the
2017 Conservative manifesto also have low counts (29-31%) but surprisingly
Blair's quick fire responses to Paxman boast the lowest percentage of unique
words of all speeches analysed (27%).
