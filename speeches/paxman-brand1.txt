Russell Brand, who are you to edit a political magazine?

But is it true you don’t even vote?

Well, how do you have any authority to talk about politics then?

They being?

How do you imagine that people get power?

They get power by being voted in, that’s how they get power.

You can’t even be asked to vote.

In a democracy, that’s how it works.

No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying if you can’t be asked to
vote, why should we be asked to listen to your political point of view?

Well, why don’t you change it then?

Well, why don’t you start by voting?

When did you last vote?

You’ve never, ever voted?

So you struck an attitude, what, before the age of 18?

You’re blaming the political class for the fact that you had a
drug problem?

Well of course it doesn’t work for them if they didn’t bother to
vote.

Yeah, there is –

You don’t believe in democracy. You want a revolution don’t you?

All of those things may be true.

But you took – I wouldn’t argue with you about many of them.

It’s possibly because –

You are a very trivial man.

Yes.

I’m not having a go at you because you want a revolution. Many
people want a revolution. But I’m asking you what it would be like.

What’s the scheme, that’s all I’m asking. What’s the scheme? You
talk vaguely about revolution – what is it?

Who would levy these taxes?

Government. What used to be a government?

Right. And how would they be chosen?

You're calling for revolution!

There are many people who would agree with you.

The current system is not engaging with all sorts of problems,
yes. And they feel apathetic, really apathetic.

But if they were to take you seriously, and not to vote –

It does make a difference.

Well now you’re being facetious.

You’re not going to solve world problems by facetiousness.

Sometimes.

I’m not having a go at you about that. I’m just asking you why we
should take you seriously when you’re so unspecific about what –

Well, you don't think that it's possible as human beings they’re
simply overwhelmed by the scale of the problem?

You don’t really believe that.

Ed – I mean Ed Miliband wasn't elite.

He did, but he then went to a comprehensive school in north
London.

Because by the time somebody comes along you might think it worth
voting for, it may be too late.

I’m surprised you can be facetious when you’re that angry about
it.

Do you see any hope?
