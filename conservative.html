THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY
MANIFESTO 2017

1
The next five years are the most challenging
that Britain has faced in my lifetime.
Brexit will define us: our place in the world, our
economic security and our future prosperity.
So now more than ever, Britain needs a strong and
stable government to get the best Brexit deal for our
country and its people.
Now more than ever, Britain needs strong and stable
leadership to make the most of the opportunities
Brexit brings for hardworking families.
Now more than ever, Britain needs a clear plan.
This manifesto, Forward, Together: Our Plan for
a Stronger Britain and a Prosperous Future will meet
the great challenges of our time, beyond Brexit.
With this plan and with a strong hand through Brexit,
we will build a stronger, fairer, more prosperous
Britain, for all of us.

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
FOREWORD
This election is the most important this country has faced in my lifetime. Our
future
prosperity, our place in the world, our standard of living, and the
opportunities we want
for our children – and our children’s children – all depend on getting the next
five years
right. If we fail, the consequences for Britain and for the economic security of
ordinary,
working people across this country will be significant. If we succeed, the
opportunities
ahead of us are great.
Now more than ever, Britain needs a strong and stable government to get the best
deal
for our country. Now more than ever, Britain needs strong and stable leadership
to
make the most of the opportunities Brexit brings.
I believe our United Kingdom can emerge from this period of great national
change
stronger and more prosperous than ever before. I believe we can be a country
that stands
tall in the world and provides leadership on some of the greatest challenges of
our time.
I believe we can – and must – take this opportunity to build a Great Meritocracy
here
in Britain.
The policies set out in the following pages will begin to build that stronger,
fairer, more
prosperous Britain. They do not offer a quick fix. People are rightly sceptical
of politicians
who claim to have easy answers to deeply complex problems. It is the
responsibility of
leaders to be straight with people about the challenges ahead and the hard work
required
to overcome them.
So this manifesto sets out a vision for Britain’s future – not just for the next
five years,
but beyond. It identifies the five giant challenges we face and what we will do
to address
them. In doing so, it offers a vision of the kind of country I want Britain to
be.
A Britain in which every area is able to prosper, with a modern industrial
strategy to
spread opportunity across the whole United Kingdom. A Britain in which work
pays,
with a higher national living wage and proper rights and protections at work. A
Britain
in which the economy is strong to support world-class public services, with the
most
ambitious programme of investment in people, technology and buildings the NHS
has
ever seen; record – and fair – funding for schools; and the first ever proper
plan to pay
for – and provide – social care. And a Britain in which burning injustices are
tackled and
overcome, with the first new Mental Health Bill for thirty years to put parity
of esteem
at the heart of treatment and end the stigma of mental illness once and for all.
This is my plan for a stronger Britain and a prosperous future. It is a
declaration of
intent: a commitment to get to grips with the great challenges of our time and
to take
the big, difficult decisions that are right for Britain in the long-term.
5
FOREWORD
None of this will be easy. It will require discipline and focus, effort and hard
work. It will
require leadership from a government that is strong enough to stand up for
Britain, and
stable enough to steer the country safely through the negotiations ahead.
Above all, it will require a unity of purpose stretching across this precious
union of
nations, from north to south and east to west. For as we embark on the momentous
journey ahead of us over the next few years, our shared values, interests and
ambitions
can – and must – bring us together as a united country.
We can choose to say the task ahead is too great, to turn our face to the past
and believe
it cannot be done; or we can look forward with optimism, believing the best days
for
Britain lie ahead.
I choose to look forward: confident that we have the vision, the plan and the
will to
use this moment to build a better Britain. A stronger Britain where everyone has
the
economic security they need and the chance to live a secure and happy life. A
fairer
Britain that works for everyone, not just a privileged few.
Theresa May
Prime Ministebility. We will reduce and control immigration. We
will be resolute in defending the country from terrorism and other security
threats.
We will also stand up to those in positions of power who abuse that privilege.
We will
run public services in accordance with their values as important local and
national
institutions. We will not only guarantee but enhance workers’ rights and
protections.
And we will develop our ambitious modern industrial strategy to get the economy
working for everyone, across the whole of our nation.
Under the strong and stable leadership of Theresa May, there will be no
ideological
crusades. Theble, an economy to be strong, a society to stay healthy, we need a
partnership between the individual and the wider nation, between private sector
and public service, and the strong leadership only government can provide.
Our principles
We believe these things not despite the fact that we are Conservatives but
because
we are Conservatives.
Because Conservatism is not and never has been the philosophy described by
caricaturists. We do not believe in untrammelled free markets. We reject the
cult of
selfish individualism. We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and
inequality.
We see rigid dogma and ideology not just as needless but dangerous.
True Conservatism means a commitment to country and community; a belief not
just in society but in the good that government can do; a respect for the local
and
national institutions that bind us together; an insight that change is
inevitable and
change can be good, but that change should be shaped, through strong leadership
and clear principles, for the common good.
We know that our responsibility to one ortunity has receded and people worry
about their children’s futures.
This is not right. So we will forge an economy that works for everyone in every
part
of this country. We will found our plans on the principles of sound public
finances,
low taxes, free trade and effective regulation. We will set rules for businesses
that
inspire the confidence of workers and investors alike. That is only the
foundation,
however. With our modern industrial strategy, we will build an economy that
invests for the long term and supports growth across the whole country – not
just in those places that have done well in the past few decades but also where
prosperity has waned. Governments cannot use public money to prop up failing
businesses, but they also cannot allow people and their communities to be cast
aside. It is our duty to bring opportunity to every part of our nation and to
ensure
that we all prosper together.
THE FOUNDATIONS OF
A STRONG ECONOMY
Sound money and responsible public finances are the essential foundations of
national economic success. A government that cannot manage its money properly
cannot command confidence at home or with international investors. Firms and
households cannot plan ahead if the government’s thirst for their cash threatens
higher
taxes and cuts to vital services and investment; and when things spiral out of
control, it
is ordinary, working people who are hit hardest.
The Conservatives have laid these essential foundations. Ten years after the
banking
crisis, the deficit is back to where it was. The independent Office for Budget
Responsibility
forecasts that the national debt is finally about to start falling.
There is still work to do on deficit reduction, so we will continue to restore
the public 
14
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
finances over the course of the next parliament. We will continue with the
fiscal rules
announced by the chancellor in the autumn statement last year, which will guide
us to a
balanced budget by the middle of the next decade.
This is our foundation. The time has now come to focus on Britain’s next big
economic
challenge: to foster growth that works for everyone, right across our country.
Keeping taxes as low as possible
Paying your fair share of tax is the price of living in a civilised democracy
but politicians
should never forget that taxes are levied on businesses that employ people, and
individuals who work hard and face tough decisions about how they spend their
money.
The Conservatives will always be the party that keeps tax as low as possible and
spends
the proceeds responsibly. It is our firm intention to reduce taxes on Britain’s
businesses
and working families.
By 2020, we will, as promised, increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and
the higher
rate to £50,000. We will continue to ensure that local residents can veto high
increases
in Council Tax via a referendum. And we will not increase the level of Value
Added Tax.
Corporation Tax is due to fall to seventeen per cent by 2020 – the lowest rate
of any
developed economy – and we will stick to that plan, because it will help to
bring huge
investment and many thousands of jobs to the UK.
We know that the business rates system presents considerable challenges to some
smaller companies. That is why we have supported those businesses most affected
by
the recent revaluation of busint if you value something, you must be prepared to
reform
it in order to conserve it. So it is today with our economy. Capitalism and free
markets
remain the best way to deliver prosperity and economic security, lifting
millions of
people out of poverty around the world. Markets need rules and these rules need
to be
updated to reflect our changing economy.
Guaranteeing a decent wage
We must first ensure that everyone is paid fairly for their work. It was a
Conservative
government that introduced the National Living Wage and as a result, people
across
the United Kingdom now receive a minimum of £7.50 an hour. A new Conservative
government will continue to increase the National Living Wage to 60 per cent of
median
earnings by 2020 and then by the rate of median earnings, so that people who are
on
the lowest pay benefit from the same improvements in earnings as higher paid
workers.
Rights and protections in the ‘gig’ economy
In the modern economy many people choose jobs like driving, delivering and
coding, that
are highly flexible and can be mixed with other employment. This brings
considerable
advantages to millions of people but we should not ignore the challenges this
kind of
employment creates. These workers are officially classed as self-employed and
therefore
have fewer pension entitlements, reduced access to benefits, and no
qualification for sick
pay and holiday pay. Yet the nature of their work is different from the
traditional selfemployed
worker who might be a sole trader, a freelancer or running their own business.
We will make sure that people working in the ‘gig’ economy are properly
protected. Last October,
the government commissioned Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal
Society of
Arts, to review the changing labour market. We await his final report but a new
Conservative
government will act to ensure that the interests of employees on traditional
contracts, the selfemployed
and those people working in the ‘gig’ economy are all properly protected.
Stopping tax evasion
We have taken vigorous action against tax avoidance and evasion, closing the tax
gap –
the difference between the amount of tax due and the amount collected – to one
of the
lowest in the world.
17
1. A STRONG ECONOMY T invention. It works because it is rules-based,
but the rules need to change as the world changes.
Boards should take account of the interests not just of shareholders but
employees,
suppliers and the wider community. To ensure employees’ interests are
represented at
board level, we will change the law to ensure that listed companies will be
required either
to nominate a director from the workforce, create a formal employee advisory
council or
assign specific responsibility for employee representation to a designated
non-executive
director. Subject to sensible safeguards, we will introduce, for employees, a
right to
request information relating to the future direction of the company.
These strengthened arrangements will apply to publicly-listed companies. We will
consult
on how we might strengthen the corporate governance of privately-owned
businesses.
A MODERN INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY
Our modern industrial strategy is designed to deliver a stronger economy that
works
for everyone – where wealth and opportunity are spread across every community in
the
United Kingdom, not just the most prosperous places in London and the south
east. It
will help young people to develop the skills they need to do the high-paid,
high-skilled jobs of
the future. And it will back Britain for the long term: creating the conditions
where successful
businesses can emerge and grow, and helping them to invest in the future of our
nation.
19
1. A STRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE
The strategy is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or
bringing
back old companies from the dead. It is about identifying the industries that
are of
strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through
policies
on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development –
just the
same as in every other major and growing economy in the world. It is about
identifying
the places that have the potential to contribute towards economic growth and
become
homes to millions of new jobs. And, because this is about meeting our economy’s
long
term challenges, the industrial strategy will focus on creating the right
institutional
framework to make the strategy last for decades to come.
We will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries
into practical
products and transform the world’s industries – such as the batteries that will
power a new
generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles. We will establish funding
streams to ensure
investment for the long term, and make a modern technical education available to
everyone,
throughout their lives, to provide the skills they need. We will remove the
barriers that hold
back small firms with big potential – and let them compete when government
itself is the buyer.
We will build on the success of world-beating sectors such as car and aero
manufacturing,
financial services, life sciences, digital technology and our creative
industries, and help
other sectors develop the conditions which they need to thrive. We will ensure
industry and
businesses have access to reliable, cheap and clean power. We will deliver the
infrastructure
– the road, rail, airports and broadband – that businesses need.
Increasing innovation
Our long-term prosperity depends upon science, technology and innovation. The UK
has an outstanding science base and many world-leading tech companies. We now
need
to go further. Our ambition is that the UK should be the most innovative country
in the
world.
At the last autumn statement, we announced a significant increase in government
investment in research and development. We will deliver this and ensure further
growth
so that overall, as a nation, we meet the current OECD average for investment in
R&D
– that is, 2.4 per cent of GDP – within ten years, with a longer-term goal of
three per
cent. We will increase the number of scientists working in the UK and enable
leading
scientists from around the world to work here. We will work hard to ensure we
have a
regulatory environment that encourages innovation.
University investment funds
Our world-beating universities will lead the expansion of our R&D capacity. We
must
help them make a success of their discoveries – while they have a number of
growing
investment funds specialising in spin-outs, we have more to do to replicate the
success
of similar university funds in the United States.
20
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
To fix that, we will work to build up the investment funds of our universities
across the
UK. We want larger, aggregated funds to increase significantly the amounts
invested in
and by universities.
We want universities to enjoy the commercial fruits of their research, through
funds that
are large enough to list, thereby giving British investors a chance to share in
their success.
National Productivity Investment Fund
If our modern industrial strategy is to succeed, it must address the UK’s slow
productivity
growth and it must be funded rated that in advanced manufacturing, such as aero
and automotion of shale gas in the United States has been a revolution. Gas
prices have fallen, driving growth in the American economy and pushing down
prices
for consumers. The US has become less reliant on imported foreign energy and is
more
secure as a result. And because shale is cleaner than coal, it can also help
reduce carbon
emissions. We believe that shale energy has the potential to do the same thing
in Britain,
and could play a crucial role in rebalancing our economy.
We will therefore develop the shale industry in Britain. We will only be able to
do so if
we maintain public confidence in the process, if we uphold our rigorous
environmental
protections, and if we ensure the proceeds of the wealth generated by shale
energy are
shared with the communities affected.
We will legislate to change planning law for shale applications. Non-fracking
drilling
will be treated as permitted development, expert planning functions will be
established
to support local councils, and, when necessary, major shale planning decisions
will be
made the responsibility of the National Planning Regime.
We will set up a new Shale Environmental Regulator, which will assume the
relevant
functions of the Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency and the
Department
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. This will provide clear governance
and
accountability, become a source of expertise, and allow decisions to be made
fairly but swiftly.
Finally, we will change the proposed Shale Wealth Fund so a greater percentage
of the tax
revenues from shale gas directly benefit the communities that host the
extraction sites.
Where communities decide that it is right for them, we will allow payments to be
made
directly to local people themselves. A significant share of the remaining tax
revenues will
be invested for the benefit of the country at large.
Investing in transport
We are working through one of the largest-ever investment programmes in our
roads
and railways, putting some £40 billion into transport improvements across the
United
Kingdom over the rest of this decade.
We are investing to reduce travel time and cost, increase capacity and attract
investment
here in the UK. We will continue our programme of strategic national
investments, 
24
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
including High Speed 2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and the expansion of Heathrow
Airport – and we will ensure that these great projects do as much as possible to
develop
the skills and careers of British workers.
We will continue to develop the strategic road network, providing extra lanes on
our
motorways and improving key routes whilst also paying attention to parts of the
country
left behind because of poor transport connections. We will continue to invest in
roads to
fix pinch points and open up opportunities for new housing and local growth.
Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and
use.
We want almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 – and will invest
£600
million by 2020 to help achieve it. We will invest in more low-emission buses,
as well as
supporting audio-visual displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for
rural
areas poorly served by public transport.
We will focus on creating extra capacity on the railways, which will ease
overcrowding,
bring new lines and stations, and improve existing routes – including for
freight. We will
increase services on our main lines and commuter routes, and launch new services
to
places which are poorly served or host major new housing projects.
We will continue to support local authorities to expand cycle networks and
upgrade
facilities for cyclists at railway stations.
STRONGER COMMUNITIES
FROM A STRONGER ECONOMY
Prosperous towns and cities across Britain
We have seen welcome growth and civic renewal in some major cities. There
remains,
however, a far greater gap between the capital and other cities in the UK than
in any
other major developed country. We see the opportunity to close this gap as the
biggest
prize in Britain today. It will be a great endeavour by government, business and
civic
society over many years. We are determined to lead the way in the next
parliament.
First, we recognise the value of institutions to the vitality of towns and
cities. As we explain
in chapter two, it is why we are determined to move many of the functions of
central
government out to cities around Britain where possible and to see our vast
cultural assets
reach people around our country too. It is also why we will support local growth
through
combined authorities, mayoralties and local enterprise partnerships. We will
make
each partnership and combined authority responsible for co-ordinating their own
local 
25
1. A STRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE
industrial strategy in alignment with our national industrial strategy, bringing
together local
businesses, political and public sector leaders to drive growth and economic
regeneration.
We will wherever possible deliver growth funding through these organisations. We
will
give local enterprise partnerships greater weight by backing them in law.
Our institutions of education, old and new, will be critical to spreading
success. It is why
we will back new scientific and technical institutions. It is why we want to see
universities
make their full contribution to their local community and economy, sponsoring
local
schools and being creative about how they can open up opportunities for local
people,
especially those from ordinary working backgrounds.
Our towns and cities excel when they have vibrant cultural life. Britain’s arts
and culture
are world-beating and are at the heart of the regeneration of much of modern
Britain. We
will continue our strong support for the arts, and ensure more of that support
is based
outside London. We will maintain free entry to the permanent collections of our
major
national museums and galleries. We will introduce a new cultural development
fund to use
cultural investment to turn around communities. We will hold a Great Exhibition
of the
North in 2018, to celebrate amazing achievements in innovation, the arts and
engineering.
We will support a UK city in making a bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
And in
this 70th Anniversary Year of the Edinburgh Festival we will support the
development of
the new Edinburgh Concert Hall, reaffirming Edinburgh as the UK’s leading
festival city
and a cultural beacon around the globe.
Our towns and cities should be healthy, well-designed and well-tended places. We
will
take action against poor air quality in urban areas. In addition to the 11
million trees
we are planting across our nation, we will ensure that 1 million more are
planted in our
towns and cities, and place new duties on councils to consult when they wish to
cut
down street trees. We will encourage the very best practice in the design of
buildings and
public spaces, including a review of the design of government buildings, to
ensure that
when the state builds, it makes a positive contribution to a local area. We will
do more to
reduce litter, including by supporting comprehensive rubbish collection and
recycling,
supporting better packaging, taking new powers to force councils to remove
roadside
litter and prosecuting offenders. We will do more to improve the quality of road
surfaces,
filling potholes – especially in residential areas – and reducing road noise.
Our countryside communities
We will bring sustainable growth to the rural economy and boost our rural areas,
so that
people who live in the countryside have the same opportunities as those who live
in our
towns and cities.
We have huge ambitions for our farming industry: we are determined to grow more,
sell
more and export more great British food. We want to provide stability to farmers
as we 
26
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
leave the EU and set up new frameworks for supporting food production and
stewardship
of the countryside. So we will continue to commit the same cash total in funds
for farm
support until the end of the parliament. We will work with farmers, food
producers and
environmental experts across Britain and with the devolved administrations to
devise a
new agri-environment system, to be introduced in the following parliament.
Our countryside and rural communities have been moulded by generations of
farmers.
We will help Natural England to expand their provision of technical expertise to
farmers
to deliver environmental improvements on a landscape scale, from enriching soil
fertility
to planting hedgerows and building dry stone walls. We will deliver on our
commitment
to improve natural flood management, such as improving the quality of water
courses to
protect against soil erosion and damage to vulnerable habitats and communities.
We will
continue to ensure that public forests and woodland are kept in trust for the
nation, and
provide stronger protections for our ancient woodland.
We will continue to take action to improve animal welfare. We will implement
our proposed reforms on pet sales and licensing and will make CCTV recording in
slaughterhouses mandatory. As we leave the European Union, we can take early
steps to
control the export of live farm animals for slaughter.
We will also take steps to enhance the provision of public services in rural
areas. We
will safeguard the post office network, to protect existing rural services and
work with
the Post Office to extend the availability of business and banking services to
families
and small businesses in rural areas. A third of all SMEs in rural areas use
their post
office weekly and our ambition is that all routine small business and consumer
banking
services should be available in rural post offices. We will support pharmacies
and village
schools in rural areas.
We will grant a free vote, on a government bill in government time, to give
parliament the
opportunity to decide the future of the Hunting Act.
Finally, we pledge to be the first generation to leave the environment in a
better state than
we inherited it. That is why we shall produce a comprehensive 25 Year
Environment Plan
that will chart how we will improve our environment as we leave the European
Union
and take control of our environmental legislation again.
Our coastal communities
Decades of profound economic change have left their mark on coastal communities
around Britain. We will continue to work to ensure these communities enjoy the
vitality and opportunity they deserve. In England, we will extend our successful
Coastal
Communities Fund to 2022, helping our seaside towns thrive.
27
1. A STRONG ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE
When we leave the European Union and its Common Fisheries Policy, we will be
fully
responsible for the access and management of the waters where we have
historically
exercised sovereign control. A new Conservative government will work with the
fishing industry and with our world-class marine scientists, as well as the
devolved
administrations, to introduce a new regime for commercial fishing that will
preserve and
increase fish stocks and help to ensure prosperity for a new generation of
fishermen. To
provide complete legal certainty to our neighbours and clarity during our
negotiations
with the European Union, we will withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention.
We
will continue our work to conserve the marine environment off the coast of the
United
Kingdom.

2. A STRONG AND
UNITED NATION IN A
CHANGING WORLD
Theresa May’s Conservatives will deliver
• The best possible deal for Britain as we leave
the European Union delivered by a smooth,
orderly Brexit.
• A strong and stable Union, with no divisive
Scottish referendum at this time.
• A United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund,
taken from money coming back to the UK
as we leave the EU, to reduce inequalities
between communities across our four nations.
• Global leadership on development, backed by
spending 0.7 per cent of our national income
with new rules to spend it more effectively.
• Strong defence, meeting our NATO target
of at least 2 per cent of GDP and increasing
spending by at least half a per cent more than
inflation every year.
• Security from crime and terrorism, backed by
a new national infrastructure police force, a
stronger response to white collar crime and
our world-leading counter-terrorism strategy.

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017

2. A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD
The United Kingdom is embarking upon another era in our centuries-old
story. We are leaving the European Union. We want to ensure our departure
is smooth and orderly and to agree a deep and special partnership with the 27
remaining member states.
In leaving the European Union, we have chosen a truly global role for Britain.
To
strike trade deals with old friends and new partners and take a leading position
in
the world to defend British interests, we must be strong and united.
This begins with our determination to defend the integrity of the United Kingdom
and to strengthen the Union, bringing the peoples of the United Kingdom
together.
OUR PRECIOUS UNION
We are a United Kingdom, one nation made of four – the most successful political
union in modern history. Its very existence recognises the value of unity –
England,
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales achieve less as two, three, or four, than
as the
United Kingdom together. This unity between our nations and peoples gives us the
strength to change things for the better, for everyone, with a scale of ambition
we simply
could not possess alone.
The settlement governing these islands has changed profoundly in the last twenty
years. Significant decision-making have been devolved to the parliament in
Scotland
and assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved administrations in
Edinburgh,
Cardiff and Belfast exercise greater powers than equivalent governments
elsewhere in
the democratic world. In England, we have given considerable powers to city
mayors
and combined authorities, while local councils now have greater control of the
taxes
they collect.
This positive evolution of our constitution has given a voice to people who felt
distant
from the centre of power, and responsibility to people for their own part of our
great country. We will continue to work in partnership with the Scottish and
Welsh
governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, in a relationship underpinned
by pooling and sharing resources through the Barnett Formula. We will respect
the
devolution settlements: no decision-making that has been devolved will be taken
back
to Westminster. Indeed, we envisage that the powers of the devolved
administrations
will increase as we leave the EU. However, we can still do more for the people
of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The United Kingdom Government has in the past tended to ‘devolve and forget’.
This 
32
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
Conservative government will put that right. We want the UK Government to be a
force for
good across the mproved infrastructure will help Welsh
companies benefit even more from the UK single market than they do now. We will
modernise the railway infrastructure across Wales, including new and improved
stations,
and explore ways to harness Welsh natural resources for the generation of power.
We will build on the Cardiff Capital region and Swansea Bay City region deals,
and bring
forward a North Wales Growth Deal, connecting north Wales with northern England.
We will work with the Welsh Government to encourage further cross-border
working,
ensuring that the border between England and Wales does not become a barrier to
business, education or communities. We will foster opportunities between cities
in
Wales and the rest of the UK, such as linking economic development between
Cardiff,
Newport and Bristol. We will protect the interest of Welsh farmers as we design
our new
UK farming policy and work with the devolved administrations to ensure the
strength of
the Welsh brand is maintained.
We will continue to support S4C as a part of a UK broadcasting structure and in
its key
role promoting the Welsh language, which a Conservative government first
protected.
Northern Ireland
Our steadfast belief remains that Northern Ireland’s future is best served
within a
stronger United Kingdom.
34
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
Our commitment to the 1998 Belfast Agreement and its successors, together with
the
institutions they establish, is undiminished. The next Conservative government
will
therefore work to re-establish a strong, stable and inclusive executive at the
earliest
opportunity. We will uphold the essential principle that Northern Ireland’s
future should
only ever be determined by democracy and consent.
A Conservative government will work closely with an incoming executive to
strengthen
the economy even further, to improve productivity, reduce public sector
dependency and
promote Northern Ireland as a location for inward investment. We remain
committed to the
devolution of Corporation Tax powers subject to the executive demonstrating
fiscal stability.
As we leave the European Union we recognise Northern Ireland’s unique
circumstances
and will seek to ensure that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected.
While the number of terror attacks from dissident republican terrorists has
fallen from
forty in 2010 to four in 2016, the threat they pose remains severe and the need
for vigilance
paramount. We will continue to confront and combat those who use violence,
threats
and intimidation, providing the fullest possible support to the Police Service
of Northern
Ireland and other agencies in their work to keep the public safe and secure.
A Conservative government will continue to work for the full implementation of
the
2014 Stormont House and 2015 Fresh Start Agreements. This includes new bodies
for
addressing the legacy of the past in fair, balanced and proportionate ways which
do not
unfairly focus on former members of the Armed Forces and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
The immense contribution of the security forces during the troubles should never
be forgotten. We will reject any attempts to rewrite history which seek to
justify or
legitimise terrorism.
Shared institutions of Union
For too long, power in Britain has been centred in London. This means
opportunity has
centred in London too. It is time major cities around Britain shared in the
government
of the United Kingdom. For our civil service and major cultural bodies to claim
to be UK
institutions, they need to represent and be present across our whole United
Kingdom. It
is also wrong that while some of our major cultural institutions have made
efforts to gain
a presence across the UK, others have not.
We will put this right. Starting with the UK Government’s arm’s-length bodies,
we will start
moving significant numbers of UK Government civil servants and other public
servants out
of London and the south-east to cities around the UK. We will ensure that senior
posts move
too, so that operational headquarters as well as administrative functions are
centred not in
London but around Britain. And we will do so in a way that encourages the
development of 
35
2. A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD
new clusters of public services, private businesses and, where appropriate,
universities.
We will proceed on the same basis with the arts and cultural organisations that
give
our United Kingdom such strength. Channel 4 will remain publicly owned and will
be
relocated out of London, and we will work with the nation’s most eminent museums
and
galleries to ensure their works and expertise are shared across the country.
United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund
We believe in one nation – in helping every part of our country share in the
prosperity
and opportunity of our great United Kingdom. Yet there is much to do. Current
EU-wide
structural funding was designed to tackle disparities but it is expensive to
administer
and poorly targeted. As we leave the European Union, we must look at how we can
better
reduce and eliminate these inequalities.
We will use the structural fund money that comes back to the UK following Brexit
to create
a United Kingdom Shared Prosperity Fund, specifically designed to reduce
inequalities
between communities across our four nations. The money that is spent will help
deliver
sustainable, inclusive growth based on our modern industrial strategy. We will
consult
widely on the design of the fund, including with the devolved administrations,
local
authorities, businesses and public bodies. The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will be
cheap
to administer, low in bureaucracy and targeted where it is needed most.
LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
Following the historic referendum on 23rd June 2016, the United Kingdom is
leaving
the European Union. Only the Conservative Party, under Theresa May’s strong and
stable
leadership, can negotiate the best possible deal for our country. In her
Lancaster House
Speech, the prime minister laid out the twelve principles she intends to follow
in seeking
a new deep and special partnership with the European Union. We have explained
our
approach in the White Paper on the United Kingdom’s Exit from, and a new
relationship
with, the European Union, during the passage of the European Union (Notification
of
Withdrawal) Act, in the prime minister’s letter to the president of the European
Council
invoking Article 50, and in the Great Repeal Bill White Paper.
We want to agree a deep and special partnership with the European Union. This
partnership will benefit both the European Union and the United Kingdom: while
we
are leaving the European Union, we are not leaving Europe, and we want to remain
committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.
The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on
both 
36
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the
UK. But
we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed
to
getting the best deal for Britain. We will make sure we have certainty and
clarity over
our future, control of our own laws, and a more unified, strengthened United
Kingdom.
We will control immigration and secure the entitlements of EU nationals in
Britain and
British nationals in the EU. We will maintain the Common Travel Area and
maintain
as frictionless a border as possible for people, goods and services between
Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Workers’ rights conferred on British
citizens from
our membership of the EU will remaiinheritance, but because our leadership in
the world is the surest
way to defend and advance the interests of the British people, and to extend
around the
world those values that we believe to be right.
The United Kingdom is already a global power. We have a leading diplomatic
service
and one of the largest overseas development budgets in the world. Our armed
forces are
respected around the world and enable us to project power globally. Our global
businesses
and London’s position as the global centre of finance make us more
interconnected with
the global economy than any other comparable nation.
Britain is already a significant influence for good around the world. Our aid is
giveties across the world.
We will place the BBC World Service and the British Council on a secure footing
so they
are able to promote the best of British values around the globe and build strt,
the first of its kind in Europe,
appointed the world’s first anti-slavery commissioner and set up the Modern
Slavery
Taskforce to bring together the heads of MI5, MI6 and the National Crime Agency
to coordinate
our response to criminal gangs operating across the world.
We now need to go further. We need to focus on the exploitation of vulnerable
men,
women and children for their labour, people who are moved around our own country
and between nations, as if they were not human at all. We will review the
application of 
41
2. A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD
exploitation in the Modern Slavery Act to strengthen our ability to stop
criminals putting
men, women and children into criminal, dangerous and exploitative working
conditions.
And the UK will use its power to push the United Nations and other international
bodies
to make Modern Slavery a thing of the past.
STRONG DEFENCE IN AN
UNCERTAIN WORLD
Our world is full of opportunity but is also riven by conflict, terrorism and
threat.
As a global power, we have a responsibility to sustain our fine armed forces so
that they
can defend the realm, our overseas territories and our interests around the
globe. We
will play a leading role in NATO and maintain the ability to conduct strike
operations,
peacekeeping, security missions and the deployment of a joint expeditionary
force. We
will maintain the overall size of the armed forces, including an army that is
capable of
fielding a war-fighting division. We shall expand our reach around the world. We
will
retain the Trident continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent to provide the ultimate
guarantee
of our security.
We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO. We
will
continue to meet the NATO coeats, while reducing the number of MPs to 600,
similar to other 
43
2. A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD
Western democratic chambers. We will retain the first past the post system of
voting for
parliamentary elections and extend this system to police and crime commissioner
and
mayoral elections. We will retain the current franchise to vote in parliamentary
elections
at eighteen. We will repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.
The British public deserves to have confidence in our democracy. We will
legislate to
ensure that a form of identification must be presented before voting, to reform
postal
voting and to improve other aspects of the elections process to ensure that our
elections
are the most secure in the world. We will retain the traditional method of
voting by pencil
and paper, and tackle every aspect of electoral fraud.
Although comprehensive reform is not a priority we will ensure that the House of
Lords
continues to fulfil its constitutional role as a revising and scrutinising
chamber which
respects the primacy of the House of Commons. We have already undertaken reform
to
allow the retiremen road network.
We will strengthen Britain’s response to white collar crime by incorporating the
Serious
Fraud Office into the National Crime Agency, improving intelligence sharing and
bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial
crime. We
will extend direct entry into the police, including at chief officer level. We
will continue
to invest in our world-leading security services and maintain and develop our
counterterrorism
strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad. And we will bolster
the response to cyber threats on private businesses, public services, critical
national
infrastructure, and individuals, working with the National Cyber Security Centre
to
prevent attacks wherever possible and with the police and international law
enforcement
agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.
45
2. A STRONG AND UNITED NATION IN A CHANGING WORLD
We will widen the role of police and crime commissioners to help them cut crime
for
their local communities. We will ensure that commissioners sit on local health
and
wellbeing boards, enabling better co-ordination of crime prevention with local
drug and
alcohol and mental health services. We will build on the Policing and Crime Act,
which
introduced better co-ordination of policing and fire and rescue services, with
greater
devolution of criminal justice responsibility and budgets to local
commissioners.
Punishment and reform
Prisons should be places of reform and rehabilitation, but we should always
remember
that incarceration is punishment for peoplsed on merit not privilege. To
succeed,
we must redouble our efforts to ensure that everyone, no matter who they are or
where
they are from, can have a world-class education.
More good school places
We are proud of our reforms to education, which are giving millions of children
a better
start in life than they could have expected a decade ago. Thanks to our school
reforms
– such as the establishment of free schools and academies, and changes to ensure
a
rigorous curriculum – there are more good and outstanding schools today than
ever
before. There are now more than 1.8 million more children in schools rated good
and
outstanding than in 2010. The proportion of pupils taking core academic subjects
at
GCSE has almost doubled.
50
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
There remains a long way to go. For too many children, a good school remains out
of
reach. .
Supporting teachers
We want great people to become teachers, teach in our most challenging schools
and
stay there. We will continue to provide bursaries to attract top graduates into
teaching.
To help new teachers remain in the profession, we will offer forgiveness on
student
loan repayments while they are teaching and bring in dedicated support to help
them
throughout their careers.
We will provide greater support for teachers in the preparation of lessons and
marking,
including through the use of technology, and we will bear down on unnecessary
paperwork and the burden of Ofsted inspections. We will create a single jobs
portal, like
NHS Jobs, for schools to advertise vacancies in order to reduce costs and help
them find
the best teachers.
Fairer funding
The way funding is distributed to schools in England is not fair. Across the
country,
children with the same needs and expectations receive markedly different rates
of funding
for their school place. We have begun to correct this and in the next parliament
we will
make funding fairer still. We appreciate that it is hard for schools receiving a
higher level of
fundlable across different routes and encourages the development of the skills
we need as a country.
We will put employers at the centre of these reforms. We will deal with local
skills shortages
and ensure that colleges deliver the skills required by local businesses through
Skills
Advisory Panels and Local Enterprise Partnerships working at a regional and
local level.
We will deliver our commitment to create 3 million apprenticeships for young
people by
2020 and in doing so we will drive up the quality of apprenticeships to ensure
they deliver
the skills employers need. We will allow large firms to pass levy funds to small
firms in
their supply chain, and work with the business community to develop a new
programme
to allow larger firms to place apprentices in their supply chains. We will
explore teaching
apprenticeships sponsored by major companies, especially in STEM subjects.
Lastly, we will make the system easier for young people taking technical and
vocational
routes. We will introduce a UCAS-style portal for technical education. We will
introduce
significantly discounted bus and train travel for apprentices to ensure that no
young
person is deterred from an apprenticeship due to travel costs.
Career learning
We will in the next parliament produce the best programme of learning and
training for
people in work and returning to work in the developed world.
We will help all workers seeking to develop their skills in their existing jobs
by
introducing a new right to request leave for training for all employees.
Alongside this,
we will help workers to stay in secure jobs as the economy changes by
introducing a
national retraining scheme. Under the scheme, the costs of training will be met
by the
government, with companies able to gain access to the Apprenticeship Levy to
support
wage costs during the training period.
We will break down the barriers to public sector workers taking on more
qualified roles
because of their prior educational attainment. For instance, we will ensure that
teaching
assistants can become qualified teachers and healthcare assistants can become
nurses
via a degree apprenticeship route, in addition to other routes.
We will equip people with the digital skills they need now, and in the future,
by
introducing a right to lifelong learning in digital skills, just as we have done
for literacy
and numeracy.
3. THE WORLD’S GREAT MERITOCRACY
54
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
More people in work
Employment is at a record high and we will continue to strive for full
employment. We
will continue to run the welfare system in accordance with our belief that work
is the
best route out of poverty, that work should always pay, and that the system
should be
fair both to the people in need of support and those who pay for it. We have no
plans
for further radical welfare reform in this parliament and will continue the
roll-out of
Universal Credit, to ensure that it always pays to be in work.
We will also work to help those groups who have in the past found it difficult
to get
employment, by incentivising employers to take them on. So for businesses
employing
former wards of the care system, someone with a disability, those with chronic
mental
health problems, those who have committed a crime but who have repaid their debt
to
society, and those who have been unemployed for over a year, we will offer a
holiday on
their employers’ National Insurance Contributions for a full year. We will also
provide
targeted support for young people between the ages of 18 and 24 so that
everyone, no
matter what their start in life, is given the very best chance of getting into
work.
A COUNTRY THAT COMES TOGETHER
Controlling immigration
Britain is an open economy and a welcoming society and we will always ensure
that
our British businesses can recruit the brightest and best from around the world
and
Britain’s world-class universities can attract international students. We also
believe that
immigration should be controlled and reduced, because when immigration is too
fast
and too high, it is difficult to build a cohesive society.
Thanks to Conservatives in government, there is now more control in the system.
The
nature of the immigthe pay gap between men and women. We
shall continue to work for parity in the number of public appointments going to
women,
and we shall push for an increase in the number of women sitting on boards of
companies.
We will take steps to improve take-up of shared parental leave and help
companies
provide more flexible work environments that help mothers and fathers to share
parenting. We want to help those who have been caring for a child or children
for a
number of years or supporting an elderly relative. For these people, returning
to work
can be daunting: things have moved on and people worry that their skills have
been
eroded. We will address this, providing parents and carers with the confidence
to return
to work when and how they wish. So we will support companies to take on parents
and
carers returning to work after long periods of absence and back similar schemes
in the
public sector, including the country’s biggest employer, our NHS.
The race gap
Theresa May’s first act as prime minister was to order an unprecedented audit of
racial
disparity across public services, to reveal the outcomes experienced by people
of different
ethnicities. That audit reports in July and a Conservative government will not
hesitate to
act on its findings, however uncomfortable they may be.
Alongside that assault on injustice, we will tackle those issues we already know
about
head on. We will strengthen the enforcement of equalities law – so that private
landlords
and businesses who deny people a service on the basis of ethnicity, religion or
gender
are properould not be
determined by your disability. So we will review disabled people’s access and
amend
regulations if necessary to improve disabled access to licensed premises,
parking and
housing. We will work with providers of everyday essential services, like energy
and
telecoms, to reduce the extra costs that disability can incur.
Preventing domestic violence
Conservatives in government have already acted to help victims of domestic
violence to
seek refuge. We can and should go further. We need the police to investigate
allegations
thoroughly and treat victims with the care they deserve. We need to bring to the
justice
system greater guidance and clarity about the impact of domestic vivices,
including by making it clearer when free trials come to an end.
We will also act in specific markets. A Conservative government will reform and
modernise the home-buying process so a new generation of
fixed-term council housing linked to a new
Right to Buy.
• High-quality childcare for working families,
supported by thousands of new nursery
places a year.
63
4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS
No grandparent wants to see their grandchildren worse off than they
were, yet that is precisely the fear many older people now have. No son
or daughter wants to see their parents poorly cared for or their hard-earned
assets whittled away, yet that is the reality for too many old people in care.
We
must admit that the solidarity that binds generations is under strain in our
country.
We will restore the contract between the generations, providing older people
with
security against ill health while ensuring we maintain the promise of
opportunity
and prosperity for younger generations. That contract includes our National
Health Service, which is founded on the principle that those who have should
help those wed and careful attention they deserve, nor for the people and
organisations providing that care, nor is it sustainable for today’s younger
people who
will potentially one day face care costs themselves. It is not fair that the
quality of care
you receive and how much you pay for it depends in large part on where you live
and
whether you own your own home.
65
Where others have failed to lead, we will act. We have already taken immediate
action,
putting £2 billion into the social care system and allowing councils to raise
more money
for care themselves from Council Tax. We are now proposing medium and long-term
solutions to put elderly care in our country on a strong and stable footing.
Under the current system, care costs deplete an individual’s assets, including
in some
cases the family home, down to £23,250 or even less. These costs can be
catastrophic
for those with modest or medium wealth. One purpose of long-term saving is to
cover
needs in old age; those who can should rightly contribute to their care from
savings
and accumulated wealth, rather than expecting current and future taxpayers to
carry
the cost on their behalf. Moreover, many older people have built considerable
property
assets due to rising property prices. Reconciling these competing pressures
fairly and in
a sustainable way has challenged many governments of the past. We intend to
tackle this
with three connected measures.
First, we will align the future basis for means-testing for domiciliary care
with that for
residential care, so that people are looked after in the place that is best for
them. This will
mean that the value of the family home will be taken into account along with
other assets
and income, whether care is provided at home, or in a residential or nursing
care home.
Second, to ensure this is fair, we will introduce a single capital floor, set at
£100,000,
more than four times the current means test threshold. This will ensure that, no
matter
how large the cost of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least
£100,000 of
their savings and assets, including value in the family home.
Third, we will extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care
to those
receiving care at home, so no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime
to pay for care.
We believe this powerful combination maximises protection for pensioner
households
with modest assets, often invested in the family home, while remaining
affordable
for taxpayers. We consider it more equitable, within and across the generations,
than
the proposals following the Dilnot Report, which mostly benefited a small number
of
wealthier people.
An efficient elderly care system which provides dignity is not merely a function
of money.
So our forthcoming green paper will also address system-wide issues to improve
the quality
of care and reduce variation in practice. This will ensure the care system works
better with
the NHS to redbeen verified. And we will increase the Immigration Health
Surcharge, to £600 for
migrant workers and £450 for international students, to cover their use of the
NHS. This
remains competitive compared to the costs of health insurance paid by UK
nationals
working or studying overseas.
Fifth, we will implement the recommendations of the Accelerated Access Review to
make
sure that patients get new drugs and treatments faster while the NHS gets best
value for
money and remains at the forefront of innovation.
Holding NHS leaders to account
It is NHS England that determines how best to organise and deliver care in
England, set
out in its own plan to create a modern NHS – the Five Year Forward View. We
support it. We
will also back the implementation of the plan at a local level, through the
Sustainability
and Transformation Plans, providing they are clinically led and locally
supported.
We will hold NHS England’s leaders to account for delivering their plan to
improve
patient care. If the current legislative landscape is either slowing
implementation or
preventing clear national or local accountability, we will consult and make the
necessary
legislative changes. This includes the NHS’s own internal market, which can fail
to act in
the interests of patients and creates costly bureaucracy. So we will review the
operation
of the internal market and, in time for the start of the 2018 financial year, we
will make
non-legislative changes to remove barriers to the integration of care.
We expect GPs to come together to provide greater access, more innovative
services,
share data and offer better facilities, while ensuring care remains personal –
particularly
for older and more vulnerable people – with named GPs accountable for individual
patients. We will support GPs to deliver innovative services that better meet
patients’
needs, including phone and on-line consultations and the use of technology to
triage
people better so they see the right clinician more quickly. We will ensure
appropriate
funding for GPs to meet rising costs of indemnity in the short term while
working with
the profession to introduce a sustainable long-term solution.
4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS
68
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
We will introduce a new GP contract to help develop wider primary care services.
We
will reform the contract for hospital consultants to reflect the changed nature
of hospital
care over the past twenty years. We shall support more integrated working,
including
ensuring community pharmacies can play a stronger role to keep people healthy
outside
hospital within the wider health system. We will support NHS dentistry to
improve
coverage and reform contracts so that we pay for better outcomes, particularly
for
deprived children. And we will legislate to reform and rationalise the current
outdated
system of professional regulation of healthcare professions, based on the advice
of
professional regulators, and ensure there is effective registration and
regulation of those
performing cosmetic interventions.
We will also help the million and more NHS clinicians and support staff develop
the skills
they need and the NHS requires in the decades ahead. We will encourage the
development
of new roles and create a diverse set of potential career paths for the NHS
workforce. And
we will reform medical education, including helping universities and local
health systems
work closer together to develop the roles and skills needed to serve patients.
We want the NHS to become a better employer. We will strengthen the entitlement
to
flexible working to help those with caring responsibilities for young children
or older
relatives. We will introduce new services for employees to give them the support
they
need, including quicker access to mental health and musculoskeletal services. We
will
act to reduce bullying rates indisciplines; we shall ensure medical exams better
reflect the importance of this area. And
4. A RESTORED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS
70
THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
we will improve the co-ordination of mental health services with other local
services,
including police forces and drug and alcohol rehabilitation services.
We have a specific task to improve standards of care for those with learning
disabilities
and autism. We will work to reduce stigma and discrimination and implement in
full the
Transforming Care Programme.
We will improve the care we give people at the end of life. We will fulfil the
commitment we
made that every person should receive attentive, high quality, compassionate
care, so that
their pain is eased, their spiritual needs met and their wishes for their
closing weeks, days
and hours respected. We will ensure all families who lose a baby are given the
bereavement
support they need, including a new entitlement to child bereavement leave.
HOMES FOR ALL
We have not built enough homes in this country for generations, and buying or
renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable. If we do not put this
right, we
will be unable to extend the promise of a decent home, let alone home ownership,
to the
millions who deserve it.
We will fix the dysfunctional housing market so that housing is more affordable
and
people have the security they need to plan for the future. The key to this is to
build
enough homes to meet demand. That will slow the rise in housing costs so more
ordinary,
working families can afford to buy a home and bring the cost of renting down.
And it will
ensure that more private capital is invested in more productive investment,
helping the
economy to grow faster and more securely in future years.
We will meet our 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020
and we
will deliver half a million more by the end of 2022. We will deliver the reforms
proposed
in our Housing White Paper to free up more land for new homes in the right
places, speed
up build-out by encouraging modern methods of construction and give councils
powers
to intervene where developers do not act on their planning permissions; and we
will
diversify who builds homes in this country.
More homes will not mean poor quality homes. For too long, careless developers,
high
land costs and poor planning have conspired to produce housing developments that
do
not enhance the lives of those living there. We have not provided the
infrastructure,
parks, quality of space and design that turns housing into community and makes
communities prosperous and sustainable. The result is felt by many ordinary,
working
families. Too often, those renting or buying a home on a modest income have to
tolerate 
71
substandard developments -some only a few years old -and are denied a decent
place in
which to live, where they can put down roots and raise children. For a country
boasting
the finest architects and planners in the world, this is unacceptable.
We will build better houses, to match the quality of those we have inherited
from
previous generations. That means supporting high-quality, high-density housing
like
mansion blocks, mews houses and terraced streets. It means maintaining the
existing
strong protections on designated land like the Green Belt, National Parks and
Areas
of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It means not just concentrating development in
the
south-east but rebalancing housing growth across the country, in line with our
modern
industrial strategy. It means government building 160,000 houses on its own
land. It
means supporting specialist housing where it is needed, like multigenerational
homes
and housing for older people, including by helping housing associations increase
their
specialist housing stock.
We will never achieve the numbers of new houses we require without the active
participation of social and municipal housing providers. This must not be done
at the
expense of high standards, however: councils have been amongst the worst
offenders in
failing to build sustainable, integrated communities. In some instances, they
have built
for political gain rather than for social purpose. So we will help councils to
build, but only
those councils who will build high-qoung people. Half
of all mental health conditions become established in people before the age of
fourteen.
So we will ensure better access to care for children and young people. A
Conservative
government will publish a green paper on young people’s mental health before the
end of
this year. We will introduce mental health first aid training for teachers in
every primary
and secondary school by the end of the parliament and ensure that every school
has a 
73
single point of contact with mental health services. Every child will learn
about mental
wellbeing and the mental health risks of internet harms in the curriculum. And
we
will reform Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services so that children with
serious
conditions are seen within an appropriate timeframe and no child has to leave
their local
area and their family to receive normal treatment.
Protecting vulnerable children and families
We have made significant progress in helping vulnerable children and families
over
the past seven years. Our investments in the social work profession and in
successful,
innovative programmes have given tens of thousands of vulnerable families the
coordinated
support they need.
Placing a child under the oversight of social services and taking a child into
care are
amongst the most serious duties the state may discharge. We will demand all
local
authorities be commissioners of the highest-quality family support and child
protection
services, removing these responsibilities from the weakest councils and placing
them
in trust. We will ensure that councils provide consistency of care and cannot
relocate
vulnerable children far from their home when it is not in their best interests
to do so. We
will review support for Children in Need to understand why their outcomes are so
poor
and what more support they might require, in and out of school.
Finally, we shall explore ways to improve the family justice system. The family
courts
need to do more to support families, valuing the roles of mothers and fathers,
while
ensuring parents face up to their responsibilities.

THE CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST PARTY MANIFESTO 2017
Theresa May’s Conservatives will deliver
• The world’s most dynamic digital economy,
giving digital businesses access to the
investment, skills and talent they need to
succeed.
• Protections for people’s data online, backed
by a new data protection law.
• Safety for children online, and new rights
to require social media companies to delete
informatll help provide the
skills and digital infrastructure that creative companies need and will seek to
build upon
the favourable tax arrangements that have helped them, including the highly
successful
creative industries tax credits scheme. We will ensure there is a robust system
for
protection of intellectual property when the UK has left the EU, with strong
protections
against infringement.
We will make doing business online easier for companies and consumers. We will
give
businesses the right to inssonal data, and an
expectation that personal data held should be stored in a secure way. To create
a sound
ethical framework for how data is used, we will institute an expert Data Use and
Ethics
Commission to advise regulators and parliament on the nature of data use and how
best
to prevent its abuse. The Commission will help us to develop the principles and
rules
that will give people confidence that their data is being handled properly.

this commission, we will bring forward a new data protection law, fit for our
new data
age, to ensure the very best standards for the safe, flexible and dynamic use of
data and
enshrining our global leadership in the ethical and proportionate regulation of
data. We
will put the National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care on a statutory
footing to
ensure data security standards are properly enforced.
We will continue with our £1.9 billion investment in cyber security and build on
the
successful establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre through our
worldleading
cyber security strategy. We will make sure that our public services, businesses,
charities and individual users are protected from cyber risks. We will further
strengthen
cyber security standards for government and public services, requiring all
public services
to follow the most up to date cyber security techniques appropriate.
A free media
At a time when the internet is changing the way people obtain their news, we
also
need to take steps to protect the reliability and objectivity of information
that is
essential to our democracy and a free and independent press. We will ensure
content
creators are appropriately rewarded for the content they make available online.
We
will be consistent in our approach to regulation of online and offline media.
Given the
comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and given the
lengthy
investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged
wrongdoing,
we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the
culture,
practices and ethics of the press. We will repeal Section 40 of the Crime and
Courts
Act 2014, which, if enacted, would force media organisations to become members
of a
flawed regulatory system or risk having to pay the legal costs of both sides in
libel and
privacy cases, even if they win.
DIGITAL GOVERNMENT AND
PUBLIC SERVICES
We believe government should not only be exceptional in dealing digitally with
the
people it serves but should also at the forefront of using digital technology in
all its
systems so that it can deliver better public services.
We will therefore create a new presumption of digital government services by
default
and an expectation that all government services are fully accessible online,
with
assisted digital support available for all public sector websites. We will
publish far more
information about public services online, including relevant information about
local
issues and public transport so that every person can find out up to date
information
about roadworks, planning applications and bus routes online, without the hassle
and 
81
delay that currently exists. We will create new ’schools maps’ to help parents
choose the
school that is right for their child, giving them key information about quality
of teaching,
attainment and the curriculum of local schools as they choose their school
preferences
to support their decisions.
We will publish operational performance data of all public-facing services for
open
comparison as a matter of course – helping the public to hold their local
services to account,
or choose other better services if they prefer. In doing so, central and local
government
will be required to release societies and stable
democracies – the rule of law, privacy and security – to be undermined.
So we will establish a regulatory framework in law to underpin our digital
charter and
to ensure that digital companies, social media platforms and content providers
abide
by these principles. We will introduce a sanctions regime to ensure compliance,
giving
regulators the ability to fine or prosecute those companies that fail in their
legal duties,
and to order the removal of content where it clearly breaches UK law. We will
also create
a power in law for government to introduce an industry-wide levy from social
media
companies and communication service providers to support awareness and
preventative
activity to counter internet harms, just as is already the case with the
gambling industry.
Just as we led the world in regulating embryology thirty years ago, we know that
if we create
the right system of governance for the digital economy and use of data, we will
attract the
right businesses who want to become the global centre for data use and research.
83
An international settlement
These are questions with which every nation is grappling. The internet is a
global
network and it is only by concerted global action that we can make true
progress.
We believe that the United Kingdom can lead the world in providing answers. So
we will
open discussions with the leading tech companies and other like-minded
democracies
about the global rules of the digital economy, to develop an international legal
framework
that we have for so long benefited from in other areas like banking and trade.
We
recognise the complexity of this task and that this will be the beginning of a
process, but
it is a task which we believe is necessary and which we intend to lead.
By doing these things – a digital charter, a framework for data ethics, and a
new
international agreement – we will put our great country at the head of this new
revolution;
we will choose how technology forms our future; and we will demonstrate, even in
the
face of unprecedented change, the good that government can do.

CONCLUSION
This is our plan for a stronger Britain and a prosperous future. This is
our vision of a nation united, of shared opportunity, of safe, vibrant and
sustainable communities and of a Great Meritocracy, where everyone, in every
part of our country, is given the chance to go wherever their talents will take
them. In this period of profound national change, we will only achieve our
ambitions if we have the strong and stable leadership our national interest
demands. With Theresa May and her team, we will se
