<pre id="speech" width="50%">
Our whole nation has been united in shock and grief this week as a night out at a
concert ended in horrific terror and the brutal slaughter of innocent people
enjoying themselves. When I stood on Albert Square at the vigil in Manchester,
there was a mood of unwavering defiance. The very act of thousands of people
coming together sent a powerful message of solidarity and love. It was a
profound human impulse to stand together, caring and strong. It was inspiring.

In the past few days, we have all perhaps thought a bit more about our country,
our communities and our people. The people we have lost to atrocious violence or
who have suffered grievous injury, so many of them heart-breakingly young .

 The people who we ask to protect us and care for us in the emergency services,
 who yet again did our country proud: the police; firefighters and paramedics;
 the nurses and doctors; people who never let us down and deserve all the
 support we can give them. And the people who did their best to help on that
 dreadful Monday night – the homeless men who rushed towards the carnage to
 comfort the dying, the taxi drivers who took the stranded home for free, the
 local people who offered comfort, and even their homes, to the teenagers who
 couldn’t find their parents.

 They are the people of Manchester. But we know that attacks, such as the one at
 the Manchester Arena, could have happened anywhere and that the people in any
 city, town or village in Britain would have responded in the same way.

 It is these people who are the strength and the heart of our society. They are
 the country we love and the country we seek to serve. That is the solidarity
 that defines our United Kingdom. That is the country I meet on the streets
 every day; the human warmth, the basic decency and kindness.

 It is our compassion that defines the Britain I love. And it is compassion that
 the bereaved families need most of all at this time. To them I say: the whole
 country reaches out its arms to you and will be here for you not just this
 week, but in the weeks and years to come. Terrorists and their atrocious acts
 of cruelty and depravity will never divide us and will never prevail.

 They didn’t in Westminster two months ago. They didn’t when Jo Cox was murdered
 a year ago. They didn’t in London on 7/7. The awe-inspiring response of the
 people of Manchester, and their inspirational acts of heroism and kindness, are
 a living demonstration that they will fail again.


 But these vicious and contemptible acts do cause profound pain and suffering,
 and, among a tiny minority, they are used as an opportunity to try to turn
 communities against each other.

 So let us all be clear, the man who unleashed carnage on Manchester, targeting
 the young and many young girls in particular, is no more representative of
 Muslims, than the murderer of Jo Cox spoke for anyone else. Young people and
 especially young women must and will be free to enjoy themselves in our
 society.

 I have spent my political life working for peace and human rights and to bring
 an end to conflict and devastating wars. That will almost always mean talking
 to people you profoundly disagree with. That’s what conflict resolution is all
 about. But do not doubt my determination to take whatever action is necessary
 to keep our country safe and to protect our people on our streets, in our towns
 and cities, at our borders.

 There is no question about the seriousness of what we face. Over recent years,
 the threat of terrorism has continued to grow. You deserve to know what a
 Labour Government will do to keep you and your family safe. Our approach will
 involve change at home and change abroad.

 At home, we will reverse the cuts to our emergency services and police. Once
 again in Manchester, they have proved to be the best of us. Austerity has to
 stop at the A&E ward and at the police station door. We cannot be protected and
 cared for on the cheap. There will be more police on the streets under a Labour
 Government. And if the security services need more resources to keep track of
 those who wish to murder and maim, then they should get them.  

 We will also change what we do abroad. Many experts, including professionals in
 our intelligence and security services have pointed to the connections between
 wars our government has supported or fought in other countries, such as Libya,
 and terrorism here at home.

 That assessment in no way reduces the guilt of those who attack our children.
 Those terrorists will forever be reviled and implacably held to account for
 their actions.

 But an informed understanding of the causes of terrorism is an essential part
 of an effective response that will protect the security of our people, that
 fights rather than fuels terrorism.


 Protecting this country requires us to be both strong against terrorism and
 strong against the causes of terrorism. The blame is with the terrorists, but
 if we are to protect our people we must be honest about what threatens our
 security.

 Those causes certainly cannot be reduced to foreign policy decisions alone.
 Over the past fifteen years or so, a sub-culture of often suicidal violence has
 developed amongst a tiny minority of, mainly young, men, falsely drawing
 authority from Islamic beliefs and often nurtured in a prison system in urgent
 need of resources and reform. And no rationale based on the actions of any
 government can remotely excuse, or even adequately explain, outrages like this
 week’s massacre. But we must be brave enough to admit the war on terror is
 simply not working. We need a smarter way to reduce the threat from countries
 that nurture terrorists and generate terrorism.

 That’s why I set out Labour’s approach to foreign policy earlier this month. It
 is focused on strengthening our national security in an increasingly dangerous
 world.

 We must support our Armed Services, Foreign Office and International
 Development professionals, engaging with the world in a way that reduces
 conflict and builds peace and security.

 Seeing the army on our own streets today is a stark reminder that the current
 approach has failed. So, I would like to take a moment to speak to our soldiers
 on the streets of Britain. You are doing your duty as you have done so many
 times before.

 I want to assure you that, under my leadership, you will only be deployed
 abroad when there is a clear need and only when there is a plan and you have
 the resources to do your job to secure an outcome that delivers lasting peace.

 That is my commitment to our armed services. This is my commitment to our
 country. I want the solidarity, humanity and compassion that we have seen on
 the streets of Manchester this week to be the values that guide our government.
 There can be no love of country if there is neglect or disregard for its
 people. No government can prevent every terrorist attack.  If an individual is
 determined enough and callous enough, sometimes they will get through.

 But the responsibility of government is to minimise that chance, to ensure the
 police have the resources they need, that our foreign policy reduces rather
 than increases the threat to this country, and that at home we never surrender
 the freedoms we have won, and that terrorists are so determined to take away.
 Too often government has got it wrong on all three counts and insecurity is
 growing as a result. Whoever you decide should lead the next government must do
 better.


 Today, we must stand united. United in our communities, united in our values
 and united in our determination to not let triumph those who would seek to
 divide us. So for the rest of this election campaign, we must be out there
 demonstrating what they would take away: our freedom; our democracy; our
 support for one another. Democracy will prevail. We must defend our democratic
 process, win our arguments by discussion and debate, and stand united against
 those who would seek to take our rights away, or who would divide us.

  Last week, I said that the Labour Party was about bringing our country
	together. Today I do not want to make a narrow party political point. Because
	all of us now need to stand together. Stand together in memory of those who
	have lost their lives. Stand together in solidarity with the city of
	Manchester. And – stand together for democracy.

	Because when we talk about British values, including tolerance and mutual
	support, democracy is at the very heart of them. And our General Election
	campaigns are the centrepieces of our democracy – the moment all our people
	get to exercise their sovereign authority over their representatives.

	Rallies, debates, campaigning in the marketplaces, knocking on doors,
	listening to people on the streets, at their workplaces and in their homes –
	all the arts of peaceful persuasion and discussion – are the stuff of our
	campaigns.

	They all remind us that our government is not chosen at an autocrats’ whim or
	by religious decree and never cowed by a terrorist’s bomb.

	Indeed, carrying on as normal is an act of defiance – democratic defiance – of
	those who do reject our commitment to democratic freedoms.

	But we cannot carry on as though nothing happened in Manchester this week.

	So, let the quality of our debate, over the next fortnight, be worthy of the
	country we are proud to defend. Let’s have our arguments without impugning
	anyone’s patriotism and without diluting the unity with which we stand against
	terror.

	Together, we will be stronger. Together we can build a Britain worthy of those
	who died and those who have inspired us all in Manchester this week. Thank
	you.
