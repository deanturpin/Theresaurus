# DUP
- the introduction of a NI Register of Animal Cruelty Offenders
   and the seriousness of these animal cruelty offences reflected in
	    the sentences handed down by courts;

# UKIP
- disabled
- Bigots who shout ‘racism’ or ‘Islamophobia’ will not intimidate us. [...] They need to get their moral compasses fixed.
- Implement a screening programme for girls identified to be at risk of FGM from
birth to age sixteen, consisting of annual non-invasive physical check-ups
- Carry out additional check-ups on girls at risk when they return to the UK from
trips to countries where FGM is known to be customary
- Clothing that hides identity, puts up barriers to communication, limits employment opportunities, hides evidence of domestic abuse, and prevents intake of essential vitamin D from sunlight is not liberating.
- Requiring Ofsted to conduct snap inspections of schools when parents or pupils have raised concerns that: °   ^GGirls are being offered unequal access to music, dance, PE or drama lessons, or are otherwise discriminated against 
- The wealthy might feel safe, secreted away in large houses in lovely areas,
	living behind electronic gates and protected by top-of-the range burglar
	alarms. It is a different story for working class people forced to watch as
	their communities are blighted by the criminality and antisocial behaviour
	perpetrated by a wrecking minority on their less gentrified estates. It seems
	only UKIP will stand up for them.


# Nuclear

UKIP will retain Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent. Give the continued existence of rogue states such as North Korea, any other policy would be utterly irresponsible.

The DUP has consistently supported the maintenance of the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent and will continue to support Trident’s renewal. One of the reasons for the need to renew is the systematic failure of the international community to deal with the issue of nuclear proliferation. We believe the UK should use all international forums to completely overhaul the approaches to counter proliferation and support efforts to prevent the likes of North Korean dictatorships from gaining and distributing such technology.
