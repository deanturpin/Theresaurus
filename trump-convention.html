<pre id="speech" width="50%">
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your
nomination for the presidency of the United States.

U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! Who would’ve believed that when we started this
journey on June 16, last year, we and I say we, because we are a team, would
have received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican
Party, and that the Republican Party would get 60% more votes than it received
eight years ago. Who would've believed this? Who would’ve believed this? The
Democrats on the other hand, received 20% fewer votes than they got four years
ago, not so good, not so good.

Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our
country back to safety, prosperity and peace. We will be a country of generosity
and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.

Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our
police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any
politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.

Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence
in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this
violence personally, some have even been its victims.

I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our
nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end. Beginning on January
20th, 2017, safety will be restored.

The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.

It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.

I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so
politically correct anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the
carefully crafted lies and the media myths, the Democrats are holding their
convention next week. Go there.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American
people with the truth, and nothing else.

These are the facts:

Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this
administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.

Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the
largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by
50%. They're up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.

In the president’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the
victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the
Chicago area since he took office.

The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50%
compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with
criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to
threaten peaceful citizens.

The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far
this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by
the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on
public safety or resources.

One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he
ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old
and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point
average, No. 1 in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he
is now a fugitive from the law.

I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing
daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. No more.
One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.

What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been
edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10
African American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American
youth are now not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than
when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another
14 million people have left the workforce entirely.

Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That's 16 years
ago. Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high. Think of
this, think of this: Our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion last year alone.
We're gonna fix that.

The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to
more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it?
Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition,
and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.

Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through
one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember
the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors
at gunpoint.gotten long.

These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.

I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our
politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no
patience for injustice.

How great are our police, and how great is Cleveland? Thank you.

I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, of
which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will or the
couraust also address the growing threats we face from outside America. We are
going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast. Once
again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.

Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped
apart. A nation in mourning.

The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been
proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San
Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon and a military recruiting center in
Chattanooga, Tennessee, and many, many other locations.

Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely
murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ
community. No good, and we're gonna stop it. As your president, I will do
everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and
oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me.

And I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what
I just said. Thank you.

To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.

We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in
the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and
regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and in Syria.
Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying
ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly,
we're going to win, we're going to win fast.

This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel.

Recently, I have said that NATO was obsolete. Because it did not properly cover
terrorism. And also, that many of the member countries were not paying their
fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly
thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order
to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction.

Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any
nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting
mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.

My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- think of this,
think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening -- a 550%
increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into
our country already under the leadership of President Obama. She proposes this
despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find
out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into
our country who will support our values and love our people.

Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country
and never ever will be.

Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment
for our citizens, especially for African American and Latino workers. We are
going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the
American people.

On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal
immigrants. Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They're
just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely.
Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even
close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and
fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders.
Which we can solve. We have to solve it.

These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no
demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. My
opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead,
my opponent wants sanctuary cities. But where was the sanctuary for Kate
Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann and Sabine and Jamiel?
Where was sanctuary for all of, aw, it's so sad to even be talking about it,
because we can solve it so quickly. Where was the sanctuary for the other
Americans who have been so brutally murdered and who have suffered so horribly?

These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any
longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to
support them, to send them our love and to pledge in their honor that we will
save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.

We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop
the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our
communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s border
patrol agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our
lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.

By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human
smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it.
It won't be happening very much any more, believe me. Peace will be restored. By
enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally
receive the respect that they deserve.

Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been
deniound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. And I mean
everyone.

America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will
cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe
me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue
of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation
is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very,
very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of
American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating
economic activity over the next four decades.

My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great
steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business. That will never
happen when I am president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going bat, great
judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother
Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me.

I have had a truly great life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive
mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It’s
time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but
we're going to start winning again! But to do that, we must break free from the
petty politics of the past.

America is a nation of believers, dreamers and strivers that is being led by a
group of censors, critics and cynics.

Remember: All of the people telling you you can’t have the country you want are
the same people telling you that wouldn't stand. I mean they said Trump doesn't
stand a chance of being here tonight, not a chance. The same people. Oh, we love
defeating those people don't we. We love defeating them. Love it, love it. No
longer can we rely on those elites in media and politics who will say anything
to keep our rigged system in place.

Instead, we must choose to believe In America. History is watching us now. We
don't have much time. But history is watching. It’s waiting to see if we will
rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still
free and independent and strong.

I am asking for you to support tonight so that I can be your champion in the
White House. And I will be your champion. My opponent asks her supporters to
recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: "I’m With Her." I choose to recite
a different pledge.

My pledge reads: “I’m With You – The American People.”

I am your voice.

So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for
their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you. I will fight for
you, and I will win for you.

To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and all of our towns, I make this
promise: We will make America strong again.

We will make America proud again.

We will make America safe again.

And we will make America great again.

God bless you and goodnight. I love you.
