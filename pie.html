<h1>Jonathan Pie</h1>

I've missed out the lead line as it's in reporter style.

<pre id="speech" width="50%">
Prime Minister, or now she's now calling herself: Commander in Chief. Deploying
the army because there aren't enough police around because as home secretary she
got rid of most of them. 

What? What?! I'm just carrying on as normal, Tim. Isn't that what I'm supposed
to do? Carry on as normal? Which generally involves me getting annoyed at
something. You know? At you. Or the fucking Tories and their insidious policies.
Or, or the left, because they're obsessed with diversity as long as it isn't
diversity of opinion. Or the dog. Because he's done a big shit on the kitchen
floor. No terrorist is gonna stop him doing that. Good on him! He's just getting
on with his day, as normal, curling one off in front of the fridge for me to
step in. The problem is this time carrying on as normal it just , it feels like
apathy, it doesn't achieve anything. You have the choice of either carrying on
as normal or what, slam poetry? What I'm supposed to do is shut up, write
something heartfelt on my Facebook page about solidarity and coming together,
about free hugs in the Arndale Centre: I'm sick of it. I'm sick of minute
silences, I don't wanna be silent, I wanna fucking scream. But apparently if I
get angry they've won. Because apparently we have one weapon the terrorists
don't have. And that's love, we can fight them with that. That and tealights!
Lots of tealights, apparently.

I get it but I'm just not feeling the love right now. I'm feeling
nothing but hate, right now, for a man who thinks blowing up children will get
him a free pass into paradise. Who told him that? Where did he get that idea
from? That what's I wanna know. This man, this man doesn't represent the Muslim
community, of course he doesn't. But isn't it time to stop pretending that this
has nothing to do with religion? After, after the Westminter attacks, right,
some archbishop came out and said: we may never know why he did this. Check his
Whatsapp, he says he's waging jihad.

Why can't we talk about that? Why pretend this isn't about ideology? Look at the
target: young, teenage girls enjoying themselves, dancing to pop music. They
were targeted for a reason, based on a twisted version of a religious ideology.
If you pretend it isn't it doesn't just go away. We've got to have a
conversation, we've got to stop this idea that there are certain topics that we
just don't talk about. Sensitive issues need more discussion not less. Charlie
Hebdo, right, those guys were killed for publishing satirical cartoons. What are
they supposed to do? Stop satirising certain things for fear of causing offence?
No, I'm sorry. An extremist religious zealot with a machine gun or a bomb
strapped to his chest doesn't need protection from cartoons. If they hadn't been
weilding military grade weaponary I'd a told them to grow up.

Yeah, yeah I know. That's the thing, it's not hard to imagine, it's too easy to
imagine. It coulda been, it coulda been mine... not at a pop concert. He's not
into pop music he's into Postman Pat. And, and that's it. I try and make it
educational for him, he knows more about the privatisation of Royal Mail than
any other three-year-old in the country. 

I just don't feel like lighting a tealight and singing kum-by-ah, that's all. So
instead I've decided to carry on as normal, OK?
